# Exercise-Tracker
Simple single-page application for tracking exercises.

React was used for the front-end UI application, a REST API was written using Node and Express for the back-end web service, and MongoDB was used for persistence.

Adding a exercise to the table requires all the following properties and they must be entered as their corresponding data type below:
```

name	     String	   The name of the exercise
reps	     Number	   The number of times the exercise was performed
weight	     Number	   The weight of the weights used for the exercise
unit	     String	   The unit of measurement of the weight. Only values allowed are kgs and lbs
date	     String        The date the exercise was performed. Specified as MM-DD-YY, e.g., 07-30-21.
